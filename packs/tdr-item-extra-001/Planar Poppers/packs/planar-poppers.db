Eveything from rotten eggs to racoon feces. Regardless of the taste, these candies can send those that eat them to otherworldly planes or temporarily addle their minds beyond recognition.</p><p></p><p>When consuming a popper, if you have the Goblin language proficiency you may choose which plane to travel to as if you cast Plane Shift but can not bring anyone else with you.</p><p>If you do not have the goblin language proficiency, roll a D6 to determine the poppers effect. The effects of the popper last for 1 hour.</p><p>1. You teleport 1 mile in a random direction and believe you have traveled to a different plane.</p><p>2. For each step you take you alternate between feeling scorching heat and freezing cold.</p><p>3. Your clothes and footwear are filled with dirt and sand that you cannot get rid of as if you went to the beach.</p><p>4. The landscape around you bends and shifts continously making you nauseous. Make a DC 10 Constituion saving throw or be poisoned for the duration.</p><p>5. Your mind is flooded with knowledge of the outer planes. Make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw or have your intelligence lowered to 5 for the duration.</p><p>6. You feel waves of a warmth wash over you. Regain 1d4 health every 10 minutes.</p>",
